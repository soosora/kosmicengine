## How to Compile Kosmic

### Linux

To compile the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a build directory** (inside the project directory):

     ```
     mkdir Build && cd Build
     ```

2. **Download external libraries**:

     ```
     git submodule update --init --recursive
     ```

3. **Generate the build files:**

     ```
     cmake ..
     ```

4. **Compile the project:**

     ```
     cmake --build .
     ```

     or

     ```
     make -j$(nproc)
     ```

If you need to customize the build (e.g., selecting Debug or Release mode), pass the appropriate options to the `cmake` command, for example:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```
